# This workflow will be triggered on every commit merge to the defined branch. It involves
# 1. Checking if an AsyncAPI spec file is present in the commit
# 2. Import the AsyncAPI spec file to Solace PubSub+ Event Portal
# 4. Trigger a github workflow at a target infrastructure repo to run provisioning and configuration

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# To get started, configure the following in your repos secrets https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets
# CLI_SOLACE_CLOUD_TOKEN: your Solace Cloud Token
